            <!-- <h1>What is Celiac Disease ??</h1> -->
            <p>Celiac disease is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten. Gluten is a protein found in
                foods containing wheat, barley, or rye.</p>
            <p>If you have celiac disease, eating gluten triggers an immune response in your small intestine. Over time,
                this reaction damages your small intestine’s lining and prevents it from absorbing nutrients, a
                condition called malabsorption.</p>
            <p>The intestinal damage often causes symptoms such as diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, bloating, or anemia.
                It also can lead to serious complications if it is not managed or treated. In children, malabsorption
                can affect growth and development in addition to gastrointestinal symptoms.</p>
            <p>There’s no definitive cure for celiac disease. But for most people, following a strict gluten-free diet
                can help manage symptoms and help the intestines heal.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Celiac Disease:</span></p>
                <p>Your small intestine is lined with tiny hairlike projections called villi, which absorb sugars, fats,
                    proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. Gluten exposure in people
                    with celiac disease damages the villi, making it hard for the body to absorb nutrients necessary for
                    health and growth.</p>

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of celiac disease vary widely among people, which can make it hard to recognize. Some people
                don’t notice any symptoms at all. They also may be different in children and adults. The most common
                symptoms include:</p>
            <ol  >
                <li >Pain and bloated stomach.</li>
                <li >Gas.</li>
                <li >Constipation.</li>
                <li >Diarrhea.</li>
                <li >Nausea and vomiting.</li>
                <li >Weight loss.</li>
                <li >Mouth ulcers.</li>
                <li >Damage to tooth enamel.</li>
                <li >Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption.</li>

            <h2>Celiac Disease Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>Celiac disease is suspected if a person experiences digestive symptoms after consuming gluten. Therefore,
                it is important to conduct celiac disease tests before trying a gluten-free diet, as these tests reveal
                how gluten actually affects the body. Once a patient starts avoiding gluten, the intestines begin to
                recover.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Healthcare providers use two methods to test for celiac disease, and it is
                    preferable to use both together to confirm the diagnosis.</span></p>
            <p><span class="highlight"><b style="font-size: 20PX;">The First Method Is A Blood Test : </b></span> Healthcare providers test a blood
                sample for gluten antibodies that damage the intestines. The tTG IgA test and the total IgA test are
                used, as they are the most accurate and reliable.</p>
            <p>A positive tTG IgA result is above 4 U/mL, while a negative result is below 4 U/mL.</p>
            <p>A positive total IgA result is above 310 mg/dL for ages 17–60 years, and above 320 mg/dL for those aged
                61 and above.</p>
            <p>The levels of hemoglobin, iron, and nutrients such as vitamins and minerals in the blood are also
                analyzed to detect iron deficiency anemia or nutrient deficiencies caused by malnutrition.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight"><b style="font-size: 20PX;">The Second Method Is A Biopsy : </b></span> If antibodies are detected in the
                blood, the doctor will take a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. To obtain the biopsy, a
                gastroenterologist performs an endoscopy of the small intestine, takes a tissue sample, and examines it
                under a microscope to check for villous atrophy, which is the hallmark of celiac disease malabsorption.

            <h2>Celiac Disease Treatment</h2>
            <p>The most important step in treating celiac disease is to stop consuming gluten, as it is not possible to
                change the way the body reacts to gluten, but gluten can be prevented from triggering this reaction.</p>
            <p>Once gluten is eliminated from the diet, the small intestine will begin to heal and will soon be able to
                absorb nutrients again.</p>
